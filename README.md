# RGB-D DOMAIN ADAPTATION PROJECT
Final project of the course Machine Learning and Deep Learning at Politecnico di Torino developed by me and my colleague Marco Gullotto, @MarcoChain here on GitHub.
The repository includes the following files:
- Demp.py contains the CNN's architecture;
- Syn_vision.py contains the classes used for creating loaders;
- Accuracy.py contains the functions used for testing the models;
- Functions.py contains a miscellaneus of classes and functions: class to compute cross entropy and function to visualize the images;
- main.ipynb contains all the implementations of our experiments.
