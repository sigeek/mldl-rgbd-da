# Unsupervised Domain Adaptation through rotation as regression for RGB-D Object Recognition
Final project of the course Machine Learning and Deep Learning at Politecnico di Torino developed by me and my colleague Marco Gullotto, [MarcoChain](https://github.com/MarcoChain). The aim of the project is to replicate some experiments of Loghmani et al. paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10016.pdf) and to implement two new variations of the algorithm.
The repository includes the following files:
- [`presentation`](./docs/mldl-project-slides.pdf) to have a quick overview of the project;
- Demp.py contains the CNN's architecture;
- Syn_vision.py contains the classes used for creating loaders;
- Accuracy.py contains the functions used for testing the models;
- Functions.py contains a miscellaneus of classes and functions: class to compute cross entropy and function to visualize the images;
- main.ipynb contains all the implementations of our experiments.
- project_mldl.pdf: final essay.
